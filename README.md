# Language Learning Buddy üåç
A guideline to build a RAG-based language learning chatbot

This README provides a structured and detailed guide to help users through the process of creating and deploying a customized RAG-based language learning chatbot using Hugging Face Spaces and Gradio, highlighting key steps and customization options, complete with useful links for easy navigation.

## Build and Deploy Your Custom RAG-Based Language Learning Buddy

### Introduction
Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot can significantly enhance the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This guide will walk you through creating a RAG-based language learning chatbot using Gradio and the Hugging Face APIs.

### Why Use RAG for Language Learning?

RAG improves the performance of language models by augmenting them with external documents. This method retrieves relevant documents based on the user query and combines them with the original prompt before passing them to the language model for response generation. This approach ensures that the language model can access up-to-date and domain-specific information without the need for extensive retraining.

### How RAG Enhances LLM‚Äôs Performance

1. **Input**: The question to which the LLM system responds is referred to as the input. Without RAG, the LLM responds directly to the question.
2. **Indexing**: With RAG, related documents are indexed by chunking them first, generating embeddings of the chunks, and indexing them into a vector store. At inference, the query is also embedded similarly.
3. **Retrieval**: Relevant documents are obtained by comparing the query against the indexed vectors, referred to as ‚ÄúRelevant Documents‚Äù.
4. **Generation**: The relevant documents are combined with the original prompt as additional context. The combined text and prompt are then passed to the model for response generation, resulting in the final output.

### Prerequisites
Before you start creating your chatbot, make sure you have the following:

- **A Hugging Face Account**: Essential for accessing the platform where you'll build and host your chatbot. Sign up [here](https://huggingface.co/join).

### Setup and Deployment

1. **Choosing Your Chatbot‚Äôs Identity**: Decide what your chatbot will specialize in. This could be anything from teaching basic vocabulary to providing advanced conversational practice in a particular language.

2. **Logging into Hugging Face**: You'll need an account to access the tools required for deploying your chatbot. If you don't have an account, signing up is straightforward and quick.

3. **Navigating to Hugging Face Spaces**: Spaces are where the magic happens. This section of Hugging Face allows users to create and manage their applications seamlessly. Navigate to [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) to get started.

4. **Creating Your Space**: Initiate a new space by clicking on 'Create New Space'. It‚Äôs important that the name of your Space reflects the chatbot's role, as it helps in identifying the application‚Äôs purpose at a glance.

5. **Configuring Your Chatbot**:

   - **Selecting the Framework and Model**: Choose 'Gradio' as the framework for its user-friendly interface capabilities, and select a suitable model, such as 'Zephyr 7B', known for its versatility across various tasks.
   - **Customization**: Here‚Äôs where you personalize the chatbot. Tailor system messages and interaction style based on the language learning role. This customization will enable your chatbot to interact appropriately according to its role.
   - **Deployment**: Once setup is complete, deploy your chatbot by simply clicking the create button. Deployment usually takes a couple of minutes. After this, your chatbot will be up and running and ready to interact.

### Customization Example
To make your chatbot truly unique, consider personalizing it extensively. For instance, if you choose a 'Spanish Language Tutor' role:

- Modify the system messages to include encouraging phrases and structured lessons.
- Program the chatbot to offer vocabulary quizzes, pronunciation practice, and cultural insights.
- Provide real-time translations and personalized learning paths.

Explore different roles and tweak the system instructions to discover the full potential of your chatbot. Don‚Äôt forget to share your creations and experiences, as your insights could inspire others in their chatbot development.

### Example Usage
Here are some examples of how the "Language Learning Buddy üåç" can be used:

- **Learning Basic Vocabulary**: "Can you teach me basic greetings in Spanish?" üåü
- **Pronunciation Practice**: "How do I pronounce 'Bonjour' correctly?" üé§
- **Cultural Insights**: "Tell me about the cultural significance of the Chinese New Year." üèÆ
